## A. Data Integration and Preprocessing

**File**: `data_integration_preprocessing.py`

### Overview

This module aggregates financial transaction data from various sources into a centralized data repository. This step ensures that all relevant data is available for subsequent analysis by AI models.

### Steps

1. **Fetching Data**:
   - Utilizes an API to fetch transaction data from an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. The API call is authenticated using a mock API key.

2. **Data Conversion**:
   - Converts fetched data, usually in JSON format, into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Uploads the processed DataFrame to **Azure Blob Storage**, a scalable object storage service provided by Microsoft Azure. This ensures secure storage and accessibility for downstream processing.

### Mock Placeholders

- `ERP_API_URL`: Mock URL for the ERP system's transaction data API.
- `ERP_API_KEY`: Mock API key for authentication.
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: Mock connection string for Azure Blob Storage.

## B. Anomaly Detection

**File**: `anomaly_detection.py`

### Overview

This module identifies anomalies in financial transactions using AI-driven algorithms, aiding in detecting potential non-compliance or fraudulent activities.

### Steps

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loads transaction data stored in Azure Blob Storage into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Utilizes **OpenAI's GPT** to analyze transaction data and identify anomalies. The model prompts with transaction data and returns any detected anomalies.

### Mock Placeholders

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Mock API key for accessing OpenAI services.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Mock endpoint for OpenAI services.

## C. Report Generation

**File**: `report_generation.py`

### Overview

This module generates comprehensive audit reports based on analyzed transaction data, providing detailed insights and documentation of the auditing process.

### Steps

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loads transaction data from centralized storage.

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Utilizes **OpenAI's GPT** to generate detailed audit reports, including analysis of transaction data and detected anomalies.

3. **Report Storage**:
   - Uploads generated reports to **SharePoint** for easy access and collaboration.

### Mock Placeholders

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Mock API key for accessing OpenAI services.
- `SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL`: Mock URL for the SharePoint site.
- `SHAREPOINT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Mock access token for SharePoint.

## D. Regulatory Monitoring

**File**: `regulatory_monitoring.py`

### Overview

This module continuously monitors regulatory updates and notifies stakeholders about changes in compliance requirements.

### Steps

1. **Fetching Regulatory Updates**:
   - Periodically fetches updates from a regulatory updates API.

2. **Analysis and Notification**:
   - Analyzes updates to identify relevant changes and sends notifications to **Microsoft Teams** for proactive compliance management.

### Mock Placeholders

- `REGULATORY_UPDATES_URL`: Mock URL for regulatory updates.
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`: Mock webhook URL for Microsoft Teams notifications.
